# Session Memories - Mimesis

## Documentation Structure

Documentation lives in `docs/` folder with `docs/index.md` as the entry point.

| Doc | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `docs/index.md` | Documentation hub - start here |
| `docs/getting-started.md` | Onboarding quickstart |
| `docs/cli-reference.md` | CLI commands and flags |
| `docs/ui-components.md` | React component hierarchy |
| `docs/operations/deployment.md` | Production deployment |
| `docs/operations/configuration.md` | Env vars and internal constants |
| `docs/api/daemon-api.md` | Daemon APIs (status-watcher, git, etc.) |
| `docs/guides/testing.md` | Manual testing strategies |

## CLI Flags

- `pnpm watch --recent` - Sessions from last 1 hour only (RECENT_THRESHOLD_MS = 3600000)
- `pnpm watch --active` - Non-idle sessions only

## Tech Stack

- Node.js 22.13.1, pnpm 10.26.0
- chokidar 4.0.3
- shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS v4 (migrated from Radix UI Themes Jan 2026)
- TanStack Table v8 for DataTable
- Vite 7.2.4
- XState 5.25.0 for status machine

## Architectural Decisions

### XState for Status Detection
Status is derived via state machine (not imperative if/else) to handle edge cases:
- Stale message detection (pending tool_use older than 5s)
- Timeout fallbacks for older Claude Code versions
- Clean event-driven transitions

### Durable Streams for Real-time Sync
Port 4450 serves SSE stream that UI subscribes to via `@durable-streams/state`.
This allows multiple UI clients to stay in sync without polling.

### Centralized Configuration (config.ts)
All daemon constants live in `packages/daemon/src/config.ts`:
- Stream server config (STREAM_HOST, STREAM_PORT, STREAM_PATH)
- Timeout constants (IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS, APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_MS, STALE_TIMEOUT_MS)
- Summary cache limits and TTLs

This prevents magic numbers scattered across files and enables env var overrides.

### Utility Modules Pattern
Shared utilities live in `packages/daemon/src/utils/`:
- `timeout.ts` - withTimeout() wrapper for async operations
- `colors.ts` - ANSI codes for CLI output
- `errors.ts` - standardized error message extraction
- `type-guards.ts` - type narrowing guards (isUserEntry, isError, getErrorMessage)

### Summarizer Removal (Jan 2026)
AI summarizer module deleted entirely - goals/summaries now come from file-based status.

**Why removed:**
- File-based status from hooks provides deterministic goal/summary
- No ANTHROPIC_API_KEY required
- Eliminates "Goal generation timed out" warnings
- Simpler architecture: one source of truth

**Migration:** `server.ts` now uses `fileStatus?.task` for goal and `fileStatus?.summary` for summary, falling back to `originalPrompt` if no status file exists.

### Security: Command Injection Prevention
Use `execFile` with array args instead of `exec` with template strings:
```typescript
// Bad: execAsync(`gh pr list --head "${branch}"`)
// Good: execFileAsync("gh", ["pr", "list", "--head", branch])
```

### Kitty Terminal Control (Dual Port Architecture)
Daemon runs two HTTP servers on different ports:
- Port 4450: Durable Streams SSE (existing, one-way daemon→UI)
- Port 4451: Hono API for terminal control (new, request/response)

This separation was chosen because DurableStreamTestServer binds its own HTTP server, making port sharing impractical. The UI API client at `packages/ui/src/lib/api.ts` points to port 4451.

SQLite (better-sqlite3) chosen over in-memory storage for:
- Concurrent access from multiple UI clients
- Data persistence across daemon restarts
- Future extensibility (command history, preferences)

Terminal links sync to UI via Durable Streams by including `terminalLink` field in Session schema updates.

### Kitty Auto-Setup (Non-Invasive Config)
`kitty-setup.ts` automatically configures kitty remote control on daemon startup:
- Uses `socket-only` mode (secure, no passwords needed, filesystem permissions)
- Creates separate `claude-code.conf` via `include` directive (non-invasive)
- Sends SIGUSR1 to reload config without restart
- Creates `macos-launch-services-cmdline` for GUI launches on macOS

This approach was chosen over:
- Password mode: Requires manual password setup/env vars
- Direct kitty.conf modification: Risky, could break user config
- --override flags: Only work for terminal-launched kitty

### Embedded Terminals (Port 4452)
Browser-embedded xterm.js terminals via WebSocket + node-pty. Architecture decision: separate from kitty integration (not replacement).

**Why WebSocket over SSE:**
- Bidirectional: Terminal I/O requires both input and output streams
- Low latency: Critical for interactive terminal experience
- Separate port: Cannot share Durable Streams port (bound by DurableStreamTestServer)

**Why complement kitty (not replace):**
- Embedded: Quick interactions from UI, always available
- Kitty: Power users who prefer native terminal, persistent sessions across browser tabs

**Security model:**
- Localhost-only binding (127.0.0.1)
- Per-PTY token auth (UUID generated on create, required for WS upgrade)
- Session-scoped: Only spawns `claude --resume <sessionId>`

**Idle cleanup:** PTYs without active WS clients cleaned up after 30 min (PTY_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS).

### Session Resume via Kitty
"Open in kitty" runs `claude --resume <sessionId> --dangerously-skip-permissions`:
- `--resume` continues the exact Claude Code session from its log file
- `--dangerously-skip-permissions` skips the folder trust prompt (user controls which sessions to open)
- Session IDs from our JSONL filenames match Claude Code's internal format

### Terminal Link Recovery (Cascading Fallback)
Kitty window IDs are ephemeral - they change on kitty restart or when other windows are created/destroyed. Solution: cascading recovery before each terminal operation:
1. Check if stored window ID exists (fast path)
2. Search by `user_vars.cc_session_id` (set via `--var` when launching)
3. Search by `--resume <sessionId>` in cmdline (fallback)
4. If not found, create new tab or return error

**Important limitation:** Cmdline search only works for windows launched via our "Open in Kitty" button. Windows started as normal shells show `/bin/zsh` in cmdline, not claude. User_vars is the reliable recovery method.

### Entry Limit to Prevent Memory Leaks
Sessions can have thousands of log entries over time. Without trimming, memory grows unbounded causing OOM kills (exit 137). Solution: `MAX_ENTRIES_PER_SESSION = 500` in config.ts, trimmed in watcher.ts. This is sufficient for status detection and summarization while preventing memory exhaustion.

### StreamDB Corruption Recovery
If durable-streams client shows `Symbol(liveQueryInternal)` errors, the stream data may be corrupted. Fix: backup and clear `~/.mimesis/streams/`, restart daemon. The stream will rebuild from session files.

### File-Based Status System (Jan 2026)
Alternative to AI summaries for session status. Claude Code writes status to `.claude/status.md` via hooks, daemon watches and streams to UI.

**Why file-based over AI summaries:**
- Deterministic: Hooks provide exact paths/templates, model fills slots
- Scalable: Single file per project, always overwritten (no growth)
- Reliable: YAML frontmatter parsed deterministically vs LLM variability
- Cheaper: No API calls for status derivation

**Architecture:**
- `status-working.py` (UserPromptSubmit hook): Instructs model to write "working" status
- `status-stop.py` (Stop hook): Instructs model to write completion status
- `status-watcher.ts`: Watches `.claude/status.md` across projects
- `status-parser.ts`: Parses YAML frontmatter from status files
- `fileStatus` field in Session schema takes precedence when present and fresh

**Staleness:** Status files valid for 5 minutes (STATUS_FILE_TTL_MS), then falls back to XState derivation.

**Status taxonomy:** working, waiting_for_approval, waiting_for_input, completed, error, blocked, idle

## Known Issues

### node-pty on macOS ARM64

The `node-pty` prebuilt binary's `spawn-helper` may lack execute permissions after pnpm install. Symptom: `posix_spawnp failed` error. Fix: `chmod +x node_modules/.pnpm/node-pty*/node_modules/node-pty/prebuilds/darwin-arm64/spawn-helper`. Consider adding a postinstall script if this recurs.

Also, node-pty spawns don't inherit shell PATH. Use full executable paths (e.g., `/opt/homebrew/bin/claude` not just `claude`). The `getClaudePath()` function in `pty.ts` handles this.

### WebSocket Server Path Matching

The `ws` WebSocketServer's `path` option only matches exact paths. Don't use `path: "/pty"` if you need `/pty/:id` - handle path validation in the connection handler instead.

### Browser/Node Module Isolation

Daemon modules imported by UI (via schema.ts) must not use `process.env` or other Node-only globals. The config barrel export (`config/index.ts`) re-exports all config modules including `stream.ts` which uses `process.env`. Solution: import specific config files directly (e.g., `config/content.ts`) instead of the barrel export when the importing module may run in browser context.

### Pre-existing Test Failures
`pnpm test` in daemon has 7 unique failures (14 total, running twice from dist/src):
- Status derivation tests have mismatched expectations
- SessionWatcher test reads real data instead of fixtures
- Parser test missing test directory setup
These are unrelated to cache/timeout refactoring.

## QA Audit (Jan 2026)

Full audit in `~/.claude/plans/calm-hatching-toucan.md`. Key technical debt areas:

1. **Schema leakage**: 8 UI files directly import `packages/daemon/src/schema.ts` - tight coupling
2. **Duplicate schemas**: `FileStatusValueSchema` defined in both `schema.ts` and `status-parser.ts`
3. **Hardcoded tools**: Tool names scattered in 3 locations (server.ts, mockSessions.ts, constants.ts)
4. **Empty catches**: 18 empty catch blocks swallow errors silently (kitty-setup.ts, git.ts, pty.ts)

Technical debt score: MANAGEABLE. No circular dependencies. Codebase is healthy with specific improvement areas.

## Command Center UI Redesign (Jan 2026)

Full plan in `~/.claude/plans/zany-popping-dusk.md`.

### Problem Statement
Kanban boards are optimized for tracking work items, but we need to monitor live execution. Cards waste space, hide the terminal behind clicks, and don't scale beyond ~10 concurrent sessions. The terminal should be the primary instrument, not a detail view.

### Design Philosophy
Transform from "Kanban board" to "Mission Control" inspired by RTS games (StarCraft, Civ):
- **Persistent Terminal Dock** - always visible, selection-driven
- **Ops Table** - dense scannable list replacing cards
- **Keyboard-first** - muscle memory over mouse clicking
- **Attention system** - surface what needs intervention

### Key Decisions
| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Scale | 5-10 sessions | No virtualization needed, standard table |
| Backwards compat | Replace entirely | Clean slate, delete Kanban components |
| Terminal model | Selection-driven | Click row → terminal swaps, one at a time |
| Repo grouping | Flat list only | Repo as sortable column, no collapsible sections |

### New Components
| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `OpsTable` | `components/ops-table/` | Dense session table with filtering/sorting |
| `OpsTableRow` | `components/ops-table/` | Individual session row with all columns |
| `StatusStrip` | `components/StatusStrip.tsx` | Clickable filter badges by status |
| `TerminalDock` | `components/terminal-dock/` | Persistent terminal panel |
| `SessionHeader` | `components/terminal-dock/` | Session info bar for dock |
| `useKeyboardNavigation` | `hooks/useKeyboardNavigation.ts` | RTS-style keyboard shortcuts |

### Deleted Components (Replaced)
- `RepoSection.tsx` - Replaced by flat Ops Table
- `KanbanColumn.tsx` - Replaced by Ops Table
- `SessionCard.tsx` - Replaced by OpsTableRow
- `SessionCardContent.tsx` - Replaced by OpsTableRow
- `SessionCardHoverContent.tsx` - Replaced by TerminalDock

### Keyboard Shortcuts
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑/↓` | Navigate table rows |
| `Enter` | Select first session |
| `Escape` | Deselect / close terminal |
| `A` | Filter: all |
| `W` | Filter: working |
| `I` | Filter: needs input |
| `E` | Filter: errors |
| `S` | Filter: stale |

### Selection Model
Selection is lifted to `index.tsx` layout:
- `selectedSessionId` state controls both table highlighting and terminal display
- Click row → `setSelectedSessionId(session.sessionId)`
- Terminal swaps session without remounting (PTY lifecycle managed per session)

## Fleet Command UI Redesign (Jan 2026)

Full plan in `~/.claude/plans/nifty-petting-storm.md`.

### Problem Statement
The OpsTable/TerminalDock design still treated sessions as "tasks to manage" rather than "units to operate". The sliding terminal dock was hidden until clicked, breaking the "always-visible" principle. We needed a paradigm shift from **Project Management** to **Fleet Command**.

### Design Philosophy: "The Bridge"
Inspired by RTS games (StarCraft, Civilization) where you command units in real-time:
- Agents are **units** to monitor, not tasks to track
- Terminal is **always visible** - the primary instrument
- Click agent → terminal "tunes" to that frequency (instant swap)
- 4 static zones that never open/close (like a cockpit)

### 4-Zone Layout
| Zone | Component | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| A (Left) | Roster | High-density agent list with status indicators |
| B (Center) | Viewport | Persistent terminal that tunes to selected agent |
| C (Right) | Tactical Intel | Plan steps + modified artifacts |
| D (Bottom) | Event Ticker | Global event stream for cross-agent awareness |

### Nano Banana Pro Theme
Custom dark theme with industrial operator console aesthetic:
- Deep OLED blacks (`#09090b`, `#050505`) for true darkness
- Banana yellow accent (`#eab308`) for selection/active states
- Status colors: green (working), yellow (waiting), red (error)
- JetBrains Mono font for terminal consistency

### shadcn/ui + Tailwind Migration (Jan 2026)
Migrated from Radix UI Themes to shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS v4.

**Why migrated:**
- Radix UI Themes limited customization (pre-styled, opinionated)
- shadcn/ui provides unstyled Radix primitives with Tailwind utilities
- TanStack Table offers better architecture for tables (column definitions, sorting)
- Tailwind v4 CSS-first config with `@theme` blocks

**Key changes:**
- DataTable replaces OpsTable (TanStack Table v8)
- shadcn components: Dialog, Button, DropdownMenu, Checkbox, Textarea
- CSS reduced from ~1,300 to ~770 lines
- Nano Banana Pro theme preserved via CSS custom properties

### Event Detection Algorithm
Events are generated by comparing previous session status to current:
```typescript
// Track previous statuses in useRef
// On session update: if status changed, emit event
// Event types: started, completed, waiting, error
```
This provides real-time cross-agent awareness without additional daemon work.

### Descoped Features
- Cost tracking (API costs per session) - not implemented
- Context health bars (token usage indicators) - not implemented

These were descoped to focus on core functionality. Can be added later if needed.
